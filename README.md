Each customer will be entitled to get a special rate for as low as 35 cents per minutes if their calling duration exceeds 3 hours. It means that the longer the duration of their mobile phone usage are, the cheaper their calling rate per minutes will be. This special rate is exclusively meant for them as a reward for their subscribing loyalty. On top of that, the customer will also enjoy a fixed line rate of RM60 per month.
